# Exercises_QGIS
Questo script permette di connettersi ad una repository QGIS per scaricare, estrarre e caricare in QGIS un'esercitazione a disposizione per studenti QGIS.

The provided script requires to build dependancies through the "pip install" command. You can find 'em in Dependancies.txt. Then you must run it with official python interpreter (tested with Python 3.12) with "python exercise.py" command in your terminal.
The script allow you to connect to official QGIS.ORG website, and download a 300 MB exercise that will be automatically extracted and loaded in QGIS (Ensure QGIS is installed in your Windows device)
Finally, when download/extract/load operation will complete, the script will display the QGIS Training Manual webpage from QGIS.ORG in your default browser.

If your Windows device lack Python and you don't want to install it, I've created an indipendent PE that you can run without python interpreter and without worrying about dependancies. Good study, and good work.
